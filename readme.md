## Idea

Online school needs more than just a video call to work. Gopher EDU re-invents the online class experience, giving students an easy way to communicate with teachers, and teachers new ways to connect with the class.

## Feature Spec

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | State |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Question Live Feed        | Zoom chat is disorganized. We envision an easy way for students to ask questions, that works in the same vane as Instagram or Facebook live. Teachers can choose to show or hide questions, or pin questions for discussion. Students can like questions if they want them to be addressed.  | In progress     |
| Teacher Live Assessment   | The teacher can give a live multiple choice question, to keep students engaged, and to gage class understanding. They should be able to set time limits in a jeopardy or Kahoot fashion.                                                                                                     | In progress     |
| Group students            | Break class into discussion groups button                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ❌     |
| Student presentation mode | Teacher should be able to give students the ability to get center focus for questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ❌     |
| Full asessments           | Teachers should be able to run assessments through the platform during, before, or after a call.                                                                                                                                                                                             | ❌      |
